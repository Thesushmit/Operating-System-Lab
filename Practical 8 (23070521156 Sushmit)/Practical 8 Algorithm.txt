Aim : To implement Banker’s Algorithm.
Input:

Number of Processes and Resources

Max Need, Allocated, and Available matrices

Calculate:

Need[i][j] = Max[i][j] - Allocation[i][j]

Safety Algorithm:

Check if there exists a process whose Need ≤ Available

If yes, simulate allocation, mark it done, and add its allocated resources back to Available

Repeat until all processes are done or deadlock is detected

Output:

Safe Sequence or Deadlock warning
