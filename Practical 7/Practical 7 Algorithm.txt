Aim : To write C program to implement Priority based CPU scheduling algorithm

Input number of processes

For each process:

Input Burst Time (BT)

Input Priority (lower number = higher priority)

Sort processes by priority

Calculate:

Waiting Time (WT)

Turnaround Time (TAT = WT + BT)

Display WT and TAT for each process

Calculate average WT and TAT
