## 🛠️ Requirements

- OS: Ubuntu/Linux (preferred)
- Compiler: `gcc`
- Shell: `bash`
- Editor: `vi` / `vim` (for C and Shell scripts)

## 📁 Directory Structure

Each practical is stored in its own folder and contains:

- ✅ `README.md` (optional short description)
- 📄 `.c` files (for C programs)
- 📜 `.sh` files (for shell scripts)
- 📝 Output screenshots (if applicable)

## 🚀 How to Run the Programs

### For C Programs
```bash
gcc filename.c -o outputname
./outputname
````

### For Shell Scripts

```bash
chmod +x script.sh
./script.sh
```
