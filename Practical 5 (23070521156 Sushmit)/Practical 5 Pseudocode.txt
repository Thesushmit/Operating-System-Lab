1. Start
2. Input number of processes, n
3. For each process i = 1 to n:
       Input Arrival Time (AT[i])
       Input Burst Time (BT[i])
4. Sort all processes by Arrival Time (AT)
5. Set Start Time (ST[0]) = AT[0]
6. For each process i from 1 to n:
       If AT[i] > Completion Time of previous process:
           ST[i] = AT[i]
       Else:
           ST[i] = Completion Time of previous process

       CT[i] = ST[i] + BT[i]           // Completion Time
       TAT[i] = CT[i] - AT[i]          // Turnaround Time
       WT[i] = TAT[i] - BT[i]          // Waiting Time
7. Print CT, TAT, WT for each process
8. Calculate average TAT and WT
9. End


AT = Arrival Time

BT = Burst Time

ST = Start Time

CT = Completion Time

TAT = Turnaround Time = CT - AT

WT = Waiting Time = TAT - BT
